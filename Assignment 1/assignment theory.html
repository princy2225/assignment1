Q-1  Explain the structure of an  HTML document and the purpose of DOCTYPE.

Ans: 
    An HTML document has a standard structure:

  1. <!DOCTYPE html>
         <!-- Declares the document type and version of HTML. It tells the browser to render the page in standards mode using HTML5. -->

  2. <html>
        <!-- The root element that wraps all HTML content. -->

  3. <head>
        <!-- Contains meta-information about the document (like title, character set, styles, scripts). -->

  4. <title>
       <!-- Sets the title shown in the browser tab. -->

  5. <body>
       <!-- Contains the visible content of the page (text, images, links, etc.). -->

  * Purpose of <!DOCTYPE html>:
      <!-- It ensures browsers interpret the document as HTML5, avoiding quirks mode and promoting consistent rendering across browsers. -->


Q-2  List and explain at least five common HTML tags used in website design.

Ans:

      <!-- Holds all visible content, such as text, images, and links. -->

    2. <h1> to <h6>
      <!-- Headings, with <h1> being the most important and <h6> the least. -->

    3. <p>
      <!-- Paragraphs of text. -->

    4. <a>
     <!-- Hyperlinks to other pages or resources. -->

    5. <img>
     <!-- Displays images. -->

    6. <ul>, <ol>, <li>
     <!-- Unordered and ordered lists, with list items. -->

    7. <div>
     <!-- Generic container for grouping and styling content. -->

    8. <span>
     <!-- Inline container for styling or grouping text. -->

    9. <table>, <tr>, <td>
     <!-- For displaying tabular data. -->

   10. <form>, <input>, <button>

Q-3 Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements in HTML.

Ans:
     <!-- *   Block-level elements in HTML always start on a new line and take up the full width available. They create a "block" of content. Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <ul>, <table>. -->

     <!-- *   Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as needed. They flow within the content and do not break the layout. Examples: <span>, <a>, <img>, <strong>. -->

Summary:

     * Block-level: New line, full width, creates structure.
     * Inline: Same line, only needed width, used for styling or linking within text.
